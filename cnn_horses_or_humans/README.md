# Horses or Humans

This is a simple CNN that classifies images as either horses or humans

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**NOTE:** I would recommend running this in a virtual environment using either [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) or [venv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#installing-virtualenv)

2. run the following command:

```bash
python Okeke_10152084_Test.py
```

This will first import and train the model, followed by testing the model against the test data

The train and test data can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sanikamal/horses-or-humans-dataset). You do not need to unzip the files; the program will take care of that for you
